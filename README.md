Your task is to implement the following UI using Angular 1.6.x, JavaScript, CSS and HTML5.

Mockup image: https://www.dropbox.com/s/21r6c10bpr0naud/vlocity-code-challenge-screenshot.PNG?dl=0

Please make a Public Fork of this plunkr and share with us once you're done!

The UI consists of:
- A top bar which consists of a search box to search for a contact, 
  the login user and profile photo.
- The left side bar which consists of a list of full names of contacts.
- The right main panel which consists of the details about the selected contact. 
  The details include the selected contact photo, a button to send a message, 
  rating (number of hearts with a max of 5), a description of the contact. 
  A table of likes and dislikes.

Requirements:
- Each component(sidebar, center panel, header, etc) should be a directive with its own template.
- Fetch the people inside of a Service.
- Make sure the search works, filtering out the people on the list.


Considerations:
- The mockup is just a guideline, you can use any CSS library out there and make it look great (extra points)
- You can use CSS inside the style.scss

Extra points:
- Using SCSS
- Making the UI Reponsive
- Implementing the messaging feature
